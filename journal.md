This is the journal surrounding my lil guy project for hackclub highway!

Lil Guy is a project based on the Dasai Mochi 3: https://dasai.com.au/pages/mochi3

I want to do this project since i want lil guy but think he's overpriced (Â£42 - really?)

So -- I'm doing the objectively *correct* thing and designing my own!

16/5/25 - 2hrs:
- Researched components needed for project.
- Made a **very rough** design for how the PCBs would fit inside the shell (enjoy the rough sketch below)

(This is one of the ***worst*** concept designs I've ever made in my life - please forgive :c)
These are the part links me and (mainly my friend) ended up with:

LCD Display - https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/1-3-spi-colour-lcd-240x240-breakout?variant=30250963632211


Note - I'm probably going to have to manage the p.d from the battery when sending it to components (since 5V > 3V for the LCD) since I'm not using a XIAO board. This might be redesigned since I'm not sure if HC will allow JLCPCB assembly in the grant.
